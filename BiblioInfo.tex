\chapter*{Acknowledgements}
%\vspace{1\baselineskip}

I would like to express my deepest gratitude to my main supervisor Associate Professor Cristina Seceleanu. Your passion for research is inspiring, and your guidance, encouragements, determination, and patience have been the driving force of my PhD journey. It has been a pleasure to be around with you and get the best mentor one could ever get. I would like to thank my co-supervisor Oscar Ljungkrantz for the lively reception at Volvo Group Trucks Technology (VGTT), Gothenburg, and the wonderful researchers he introduced to me. It is my pleasure also to thank my co-supervisor Guillermo Rodriguez-Navas, for the great team work, valuable feedback, and encouragements. I am grateful to have you all as my supervisors. Your effort has made this work worthwhile.

Moreover, I would like to thank my examining committee Professor Peter Csaba {\"O}lveczky, University of Oslo, Professor Wolfgang Ahrendt, Chalmers University of Technology, Associate Professor Raffaela Mirandola, Politecnico di Milano, for accepting our call and reviewing my thesis, and Associate Professor Antonio Cicchetti for reviewing the thesis proposal. Special gratitude goes to the faculty examiner Professor Joost-Pieter Katoen, RWTH Aachen University, for accepting the opponentship. It is an honour to have you all at my defense. Also, I would like to extend my appreciation to Damir Isovic, Thomas Nolte, Hans Hansson, Moris Behnam and the IDT administration staff, who facilitated my PhD defense and influenced my academic career.

I wish to acknowledge with much appreciation the role of Henrik L{\"o}nn, Oscar Ljungkrantz, as well as Saad Mubeen and Hamid Reza Faragardi, who supported my research technically at different levels, including co-authoring joint papers. Your willingness to share and support is highly admired. For the list is too long, I briefly express my respect and love to my colleagues at MDH, and outside such as Tewodros, Abu Hussaine, Bj{\"o}rn. Your friendly support, jokes, and cultural exchanges will always be memorable.

I am thankful to Allah for granting me the well-being and strength to do my studies. I thank my parents for giving me unconditional love, and my brothers, sisters and lifelong friends Sal, Jem, Nas, Kb, Ja, Melow, Zigi, Asf, Bini, Mu and others who supported me throughout my life - thank you Big Brother~Abdulwhab for being the example. In times of emotional stress, the support of my dear wife, Elham Salih, has been unconditional and unwavering. You are strong, confident and intelligent person and love of my life, and I thank the OOG for that! Our little boy, Mohammed, you should know that we love you so much. So learn the world with open mind and make us proud!

I would like to thank VINNOVA for sponsoring this research via the VeriSpec project, in which the financial support has made this work possible.
