\textbf{ReSA: An Ontology-based Requirement Specification Language Tailored to Automotive Systems} \\
Nesredin~Mahmud, Cristina~Seceleanu, Ljungkrantz~Oscar\\[6pt]
\textbf{Abstract:} \textit{Automotive systems are developed using multi-leveled architectural abstractions in an attempt to manage the increasing complexity and criticality of automotive functions. Consequently, well-structured and unambiguously specified requirements are needed on all levels of abstraction, in order to enable early detection of possible design errors. However, automotive industry often relies on requirements specified in ambiguous natural language, sometimes in large and incomprehensible documents. Semi-formal requirements specification approaches (e.g., requirement boilerplates, pattern-based specifications, etc.) aim to reduce requirements ambiguity, without altering their readability and expressiveness. Nevertheless, such approaches do not offer support for specifying requirements in terms of multi-leveled architectural concepts, nor do they provide means for early-stage rigorous analysis of the specified requirements. In this paper, we propose a language, called ReSA, which allows requirements specification at various levels of abstraction, modeled in the architectural language of EAST-ADL. ReSA uses an automotive systems' ontology that offers typing and syntactic axioms for the specification. Besides enforcing structure and more rigor in specifying requirements, our approach enables checking refinement as well as consistency of requirements, by proving ordinary boolean implications. To illustrate ReSA's applicability, we show how to specify some requirements of the Adjustable Speed Limiter, which is a complex, safety-critical Volvo Trucks user function.}\\[6pt]

\textbf{ReSA Tool: Structured Requirements Specification and SAT-based Consistency-checking}\\%titile
Nesredin~Mahmud, Cristina~Seceleanu, Ljungkrantz~Oscar\\[6pt]%authors
\textbf{Abstract:} \textit{Most industrial embedded systems requirements are
specified in natural language, hence they can sometimes be
ambiguous and error-prone. Moreover, employing an early-stage
model-based incremental system development using multiple
levels of abstraction, for instance via architectural languages
such as EAST-ADL, calls for different granularity requirements
specifications described with abstraction-specific concepts that
reflect the respective abstraction level effectively.
In this paper, we propose a toolchain for structured requirements
specification in the ReSA language, which scales to multiple
EAST-ADL levels of abstraction. Furthermore, we introduce
a consistency function that is seamlessly integrated into the
specification toolchain, for the automatic analysis of requirements
logical consistency prior to their temporal logic formalization
for full formal verification. The consistency check subsumes
two parts: (i) transforming ReSA requirements specification into
boolean expressions, and (ii) checking the consistency of the
resulting boolean expressions by solving the satisfiability of their
conjunction with the Z3 SMT solver. For validation, we apply
the ReSA toolchain on an industrial vehicle speed control system,
namely the Adjustable Speed Limiter.}\\[6pt]%abstract

\textbf{Specification and Semantic Analysis of Embedded Systems Requirements: From  Description Logic to Temporal Logic}\\%titile
Nesredin~Mahmud, Cristina~Seceleanu, Ljungkrantz~Oscar\\[6pt]%authors
\textbf{Abstract:} \textit{Due to the increasing complexity of embedded systems, early detection of software/hardware errors has become desirable. In this context, effective yet flexible specification methods that support rigorous analysis of embedded systems requirements are needed. Current specification methods such as pattern-based, boilerplates normally lack meta-models for extensibility and flexibility. In contrast, formal specification languages, like temporal logic, Z, etc., enable rigorous analysis, however, they usually are too mathematical and difficult to comprehend by average software engineers. In this paper, we propose a specification representation of requirements, which considers thematic roles and domain knowledge, enabling deep semantic analysis. The specification is complemented by our constrained natural language specification framework, ReSA, which acts as the interface to the representation. The representation that we propose is encoded in description logic, which is a decidable and computationally-tractable ontology language. By employing the ontology reasoner, Hermit, we check for consistency and completeness of requirements. Moreover, we propose an automatic transformation of the ontology-based specifications into Timed Computation Tree Logic formulas, to be used further in model checking embedded systems.}\\[6pt]%abstract

\textbf{Scalable Allocation of Fault-tolerant Multi-rate AUTOSAR Applications}\\%titile
Nesredin~Mahmud, Guillermo~Rodriguez-Navas, Hamid~Faragardi,Saad~Mubeen, Cristina~Seceleanu\\[6pt]%authors
\textbf{Abstract:} \textit{Software-to-hardware allocation plays an important
role in the development of resource-constrained automotive
embedded systems that are required to meet timing, reliability
and power requirements. This paper proposes an Integer Linear
Programming optimization approach for the allocation of fault-tolerant
embedded software applications that are developed using
the AUTOSAR standard. The allocation takes into account the
timing and reliability requirements of the multi-rate cause-effect
chains in these applications and the heterogeneity of their
execution platforms. The optimization objective is to minimize the
total power consumption of the applications that are distributed
over more than one computing unit. The proposed approach is
evaluated using a range of different software applications from
the automotive domain, which are generated using the real world
automotive benchmark. The evaluation results indicate
that the proposed allocation approach is effective and scalable
while meeting the timing, reliability and power requirements in
small- and medium-sized automotive software applications.

\noindent \textbf{Abstract:} \textit{The evolution of automotive systems has been rapid. Nowadays, electronic brains control dozens of functions in vehicles, like
braking, cruising, etc. Model-based design approaches, in environments such as MATLAB Simulink, seem to help in addressing
the ever-increasing need to enhance quality, and manage complexity, by supporting functional design from a set of block
libraries, which can be simulated and analyzed for hidden errors, but also used for code generation. For this reason, providing
assurance that Simulink models fulfill given functional and timing requirements is desirable. In this paper, we propose a
pattern-based, execution-order preserving automatic transformation of atomic and composite Simulink blocks into stochastic
timed automata that can then be formally analyzed with Uppaal Statistical Model Checker (Uppaal SMC). To enable this, we
first define the formal syntax and semantics of Simulink blocks and their composition, and show that the transformation is
provably correct for a certain class of Simulink models. Our method is supported by the SIMPPAAL tool, which we introduce
and apply on two industrial Simulink models, a prototype called the Brake-by-Wire and an operational Adjustable Speed
Limiter system. This work enables the formal analysis of industrial Simulink models, by automatically generating stochastic
timed automata counterparts.}

% \noindent Nesredin~Mahmud, ~Cristina~Seceleanu\\[6pt]%authors
% \noindent \textbf{Abstract:} \textit{Several temporal logic languages are employed for the specification of properties, to be used in model checking. Due their syntax and semantics, they are not intuitive to practitioners in the domain of software engineers. Most engineers are adapted to (constrained) natural language to specify requirements, however, temporal logic usually employ symbols even worse their interpretation is not intuitive especially as the properties get complex. Therefore, to the practitioners, they are difficult to write in them and also are challenging to comprehend their specifications. To facilitate the adoption of formal methods in industry, several patterns and templates-based statements are proposed that abstract temporal logic complexities. However, patterns and template-based approaches are ad hoc and normally lack reference models (or meta-models). In this paper, we propose a translation from the constrained natural language ReSA specifications to Timed Computational Temporal Logic and Weighted Metric Temporal Logic, which are properties specification input languages to UPPAAL and UPPAAL SMC, respectively.}\\[6pt]%abstract
